# Meet Up App

## *** Invaluable assistant to any Salsita meet up you may ever attend! ***

This simple application has been created to demo how to turn an existing web application into a Progressive Web App.

### Project structure

The source code is divided into two main folders

 - [`server`](./server/README.md) with the server hosting the app and serving the API
 - [`client`](./client/README.md) with a single page application written in Angular 7

### Available scripts

 - `npm start` to start both the server and the client in development mode
